hydro-mechanical stress-split prototypical implementation

The fixed-stress split [Kim09](https://doi.org/10.2118/119084-MS) enables a promising staggered scheme for hydro-mechanical problems.
We use [FEniCS}(https://fenicsproject.org) as Finite-Element-Method (FEM) framework to easily test this staggered scheme on minimal models and to reproduce results from the literature.
